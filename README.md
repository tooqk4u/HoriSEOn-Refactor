ASSIGNMENT:
Horiseon-Refactor-Challenge

The assignment was to refactor the HTML and CSS of the Horiseon webpage to make it accessible 
while implementing the cardinal rule when working with someone elses code: "Always leave the code 
you are editing a little cleaner than you found it" 

This challenge required the changing of the HTML documents semantics because the code was 
essentially "Div Soup"; It also required the consollidation of CSS selectors and properties. 
Multiple comments were placed to clarify the changes made.






I had several difficulties with this assignment. The most common difficulty I found I had was 
typos. I have found that they can "break" any website and require "debugging". My tutor suggested 
that I check my code after each change/addition in order to facilitate my efficiency and prevent 
"bugs". An immediate check allowed me to determine my mistakes and immediately correct them 
instead of taking considerable time going back over large blocks of code to find errors. I know 
that VSC provides a debugging feature, however I learn best by being forced to find my mistakes 
and correct them, so this tip from my tutor was invaluable. The next significant set of 
difficulties was using GitHub. I managed to embed a repsoitory inside another respository, 
accidentally set up a first party authenticator offered by GitHub on a respository. I accidentally 
staged files so I had to unstage and remove them. I accidentally commited files and had to learn 
how to uncommit them. I found this module to be challenging, and frustrating at times, but 
ultimately very rewarding to see my work deployed as a "live" webpage.
